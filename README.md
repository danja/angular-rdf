## AngularRDF

**_AngularJS bindings for RDF_**

### Demo Installation

First you'll need a clone of this repository:

**`git clone https://github.com/danja/angular-rdf.git`**

This should create a directory `angular-rdf`, move into it:

**`cd angular-rdf`**

#### HTTP Server

A fairly minimal node.js HTTP server is provided for convenience. To use it, you should first [install node](https://nodejs.org/).

Then run:

**`npm install`**

**`npm start`**

Point a browser at:

**`[http://localhost:8088/](http://localhost:8088/)`**

- and you should see the demo application.
